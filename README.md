A little application that combines the [Mapbox.js API](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/) with geographic 
information stored with [Instagram's API](https://instagram.com/developer/). The application contains a basic Mapbox map that uses 
geolocation and the map's center to make requests to Instagram's API and pull in photos that 
are publicly shared. The query looks for public media within an 80 meter radius of the center. Site not working? It could've hit a rate limit with Instagram.
